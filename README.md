## 🎨 What is Rive & State Machine?

### **Rive** 🎬
Rive is a real-time interactive design and animation tool. Unlike traditional GIFs or videos, Rive animations are vector-based, lightweight, and can be manipulated via code in real-time.

### **State Machine** ⚙️
The State Machine is the **"brain"** behind the animation. It defines the logic and transitions between different visual states (e.g., from "idle" to "hands up") based on inputs received from the Flutter application.
